1.What is Programming?
ans:Programming is the process of writing instructions that tell a computer what to do in order to solve a problem or perform a task.

A computer cannot think or make decisions on its own.
It only works according to the instructions given by a programmer.
These instructions are written using programming languages such as Python, C, Java, or C++.

In simple words:
Programming is a way of communicating with computers to make them work as we want.

2.Why Do We Use Programming?
ans:We use programming to make computers useful and intelligent.

Some important reasons are:
a. To Automate Tasks : Programming allows computers to perform tasks automatically and repeatedly without human effort.
b. To Develop Software and Applications : All software and applications are created using programming.
c. To Solve Real-World Problems : Programming helps solve complex real-life problems efficiently.
d. To Control Machines and Devices : Programming is used to control electronic devices and machines.
e. To Work with Data and Technology : Programming helps process, analyze, and manage large amounts of data.

3.What is a Programming Language?
ans:A programming language is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks.

In simple words:
A programming language is a way to communicate with a computer and tell it what to do.

4.Why Do We Need Programming Languages?
ans:Computers do not understand human languages like English or Hindi.
They only understand machine language (0s and 1s), which is very difficult for humans.

Programming languages act as a bridge between humans and computers:
Humans write instructions in a programming language
The computer converts them into machine language
The computer performs the task

5.What is a Compiler?
ans:A compiler is a system software that translates an entire program written in a high-level programming language into machine language (0s and 1s) at once, so that the computer can understand and execute it.

In simple words:
A compiler converts human-written code into computer-understandable code.

6.Why Do We Need a Compiler?
ans:Computers understand only machine language
Programmers write code in high-level languages like C, C++, Java
A compiler acts as a translator between the programmer and the computer

Without a compiler, the computer cannot run high-level programs.

7.What is an Interpreter?
ans:An interpreter is a system software that translates and executes a program line by line from a high-level programming language into machine language.

In simple words:
An interpreter reads, translates, and executes the program one line at a time.

8.Why Do We Need an Interpreter?
ans:Computers understand only machine language
Programmers write code in high-level languages
An interpreter works as a translator between the programmer and the computer

Without an interpreter, some programming languages cannot run.
