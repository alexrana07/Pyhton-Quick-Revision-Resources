1.What is variable?
ans:A variable is a name given to a memory location that stores a value
example:x = 10
Memory location → where 10 is stored.
Variable name → x.
Value → 10.

2.What is Identifiers?
ans:An identifier is the name used to identify a variable, function, class, or any other entity in a program.
Examples:
Variable: age, totalMarks
Function: calculateSum
Class: Student

3.Rules for identifiers:
An identifier must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_)
It cannot start with a number
It can contain letters, digits, and underscores only
No spaces are allowed
Special symbols like @, #, $, % are not allowed
It must not be a keyword (reserved word like if, while, int)
Identifiers are case-sensitive (Age and age are different)

Examples:
Valid: name, _total, marks1
Invalid: 1name, total marks, if

Note: Python is a Case sensitive language that means:
NAME = 'Alex'
name = 'alex'
is different and both variable has different value
